# Using OpenSAFELY to analyse QOF indicators

## Abstract

One sentence summary

## Clinical stuff

General practice has been disrupted by the pandemic in many clinical areas (e.g., Curtis et al., 2021; Williamson et al., 2020).
Something QOF here

## Motivation

A couple of us are working on QOF indicators .
There are 25 clinical areas (e.g., Asthma, Hypertension) with around 70 indicators, some with complex rules [if you are interested here are the documents]. 
We thought that organising our QOF developments (while still learning the general case) using a single GitHub repo (not a GitHub template) with shared utility functions, documentation on starting from the research template, and ongoing discussions would help to:

- Collect and discuss general issues with QOF (project specific issues will live in their respective repo)
- Guide decision making towards which aspects could potentially become reusable actions, go into a shared library, or are project specific and need to be guided by detailed documentation

## Aim

This repo contains resources, discussion, and issues surrounding the use of OpenSafely to assess the impact of the pandemic on routine care through the assessment of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF).

## How to use this repository

The goal of this repo is to help a research go from the Opensafely research template to QOF results.
