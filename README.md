# QOF registers in OpenSAFELY

## Aim

The purpose of this repository is to provide code which replicates [QOF business rules](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/general-practice-data-hub/quality-outcomes-framework-qof) for condition registers. This code is intended for researchers to copy and use in their own OpenSAFELY study repositories, and can be used for further analyses on monthly QOF trends and broken down by relevant variables. 

This repo also contains [wikiâ€™s with documentation](https://github.com/opensafely/qof-utilities/wiki) about how we have implemented the QOF business rules. Please feel free to contribute to it, and the [discussion](https://github.com/opensafely/qof-utilities/discussions) and raise any [issues](https://github.com/opensafely/qof-utilities/issues) - this resource is in development and we welcome all contributions to help others use it.

## Contents of this repo

This repo currently contains all resources for the QOF registers for the following clinical domains

- Asthma (AST_REG

- Diabetes (DM_REG)

- Hypertension (HYP_REG)

- Learning disability (LD_REG)

- Palliative Care (PC_REG)

- Stroke / TIA (STIA_REG)

To use this repo to replicate a register you will need to use both *specific files for that register* and *shared register files*. Details of both of these types of files can be found below. 

### Specific files for each register

- The codelists needed for a specific QOF register (e.g., hypertension) are loaded in [analysis/codelists_hyp.py](analysis/codelists_hyp.py).

- The variables specified in the business rules are available in variable dictionaries (see [OpenSAFELY programming tricks](https://docs.opensafely.org/study-def-tricks/#sharing-common-study-definition-variables)) specific to each QOF register (e.g., variables for implementing the hypertension register are available here: [analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py](analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py)). 

- The logic of the QOF registers is also composed inside the variable dictionary by combining the variables created earlier using the `patients.satisfying()` function (e.g., variable `hyp_reg` in [analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py](analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py)).

- The study definition for each register makes use of the variables defined in the dictionary and defines the the population list size in the `population` variable (e.g., 6 or older for asthma, see [analysis/study_definition_ast_reg.py](analysis/study_definition_ast_reg.py)).

### Shared files across all registers

*Codelists* All codelists specified in the QOF business rules have been added to the genetic[codelists/codelists.txt](codelists/codelists.txt). 

  The codelists can be found on OpenCodelists under [NHSD Primary Care Domain Refsets](https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/nhsd-primary-care-domain-refsets/).

  Note that the *codelists.txt* file in this repository specifies the codelists for all the registers implemented here. 

- Codelists used for breakdowns of the QOF registers (e.g., ethnicity, learning disability) are loaded in [analysis/codelists_demographic.py](analysis/codelists_demographic.py).

- Variables with demographic information (e.g., age, ethnicity) or other variables (e.g., registration status) that are the same across all registers are defined in [analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py](analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py).

- Ethnicity is extracted in a separate study definition [analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py](analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py) and joined later with each QOF register.

- Commonly used dates (e.g., '*Payment Period Start Date*') are defined in [analysis/config.py](analysis/config.py).

## Repository structure 

The following list describes the general structure of this repository:

### Specific files for each register

- All codelists specified in the QOF busieness rules are added to [codelists/codelists.txt](codelists/codelists.txt). 

  The codelists can be found on OpenCodelists under [NHSD Primary Care Domain Refsets](https://www.opencodelists.org/codelist/nhsd-primary-care-domain-refsets/).

  Note that the *codelists.txt* file in this repository specifies the codelists for all the registers implemented here. 

- The codelists needed for a specific QOF register (e.g., hypertension) are loaded in [analysis/codelists_hyp.py](analysis/codelists_hyp.py).

- The variables specified in the business rules are available in variable dictionaries (see [OpenSAFELY programming tricks](https://docs.opensafely.org/study-def-tricks/#sharing-common-study-definition-variables)) specific to each QOF register (e.g., variables for implementing the hypertension register are available here: [analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py](analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py)). 

- The logic of the QOF registers is also composed inside the variable dictionary by combining the variables created earlier using the `patients.satisfying()` function (e.g., variable `hyp_reg` in [analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py](analysis/dict_hyp_variables.py)).

- Codelists used for breakdowns of the QOF registers (e.g., ethnicity, learning disability) are loaded in [analysis/codelists_demographic.py](analysis/codelists_demographic.py).

- Variables with demographic information (e.g., age, ethnicity) or other variables (e.g., registration status) that are the same across all registers are defined in [analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py](analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py).

- Ethnicity is extracted in a separate study definition [analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py](analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py) and joined later with each QOF register.

## Worked example

The steps outlined blow describe the general workflow how to use the resources in this repository for your study:

1. Use the [OpenSAFELY research template](https://github.com/opensafely/research-template) to start your own QOF project

2. Copy all register specific and shared files into your study. For example to use the Asthma register in your study you would need to add:

     - Asthma specific files:

        - [analysis/codelists_ast.py](analysis/codelists_ast.py)

        - [analysis/dict_ast_variables.py](analysis/dict_ast_variables.py)

        - [analysis/study_definition_ast_reg.py](analysis/study_definition_ast_reg.py)

     - Shared files:

        - [analysis/codelists_demographic.py](analysis/codelists_demographic.py)

        - [analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py](analysis/dict_demographic_variables.py)

        - [analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py](analysis/study_definition_ethnicity.py)

        - [analysis/config.py](analysis/config.py)

3. Finally you need to specify the actions that are needed for the indicator you chose in the [project.yaml](project.yaml) or your project. 

   For example, the following actions would be needed:

     -  `generate_study_population_ast_reg`: to extract the study population for the asthma register

     -  `generate_study_population_ethnicity`: to extract ethnicity for the asthma register population

     -  `join_ethnicity_ast_reg`: to join ethnicity to the asthma register

     -  `generate_measures_ast_reg`: to generate measures (here percentage acievement for the total population and breakdown by demographic variables)
